1) Install node.js

2) npm install for installing all the dependancies

3) run "npm test features" from project root

Note: The UI testing bits are not working properly, most probably Webdriver and chrome issues. I have written the spec and definitions but need tweaks to make them working. Apologies but please check the approach used.
